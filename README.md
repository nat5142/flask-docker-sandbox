# Flask Docker Sandbox


I'm a simple Flask app that runs via a docker container. Clone and use
however you want. Just don't commit to master. Or do. I don't care.

Use branches and leave them open when demoing a new concept


### TODO:

- Add compose file to orchestrate additional microservices
- Deploy to AWS via ECR. Mount as subdomain.
